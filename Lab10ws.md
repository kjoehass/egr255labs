# Resonance in RLC Circuits

### Procedure

-   **Measure** and **record** the actual resistance values of the 100 Ω
    resistor ($R_{100}$), the 47 Ω resistor ($R_{47}$), and the inductor
    ($R_{L}$).

      Element      Value
      ------------ -------
      $R_{100}$
      $R_{47}$     
      $R_L$        

-   **Calculate** and **record** the resonant frequency, $f_{R}$, of the
    circuit in hertz.

     

     

-   **Calculate** and **record** the total series resistance of the circuit.

     

-   **Calculate** and **record** the quality factor, *Q*, of the circuit.

     

     

-   **Calculate** and **record** the bandwidth *BW*, of the circuit.

     

     

-   Slowly adjust the function generator frequency until the voltage across the
    47 Ω resistor reaches a **maximum** value. **Record** the peak-to-peak
    output voltage of the function generator, the peak-to-peak voltage across
    the resistor, and the actual frequency of the signal.

     

     

     

-   Is the observed resonant frequency within 10% of the calculated value? If
    not, resolve the discrepancy before moving on.

     

-   Use the DMM to measure the RMS voltage across the capacitor and inductor.
    **Record** the measured values here. At resonance these voltages should
    have an equal magnitude but be 180° out of phase. **Explain** whether your
    observations are consistent with that expectation.

     

     

     

-   Use the DMM to measure the RMS voltage across the 47 Ω resistor and the
    100 Ω resistor. **Record** your measurements here.

     

     

-   At d.c. the sum of the voltages across the capacitor, inductor, and 47 Ω
    resistor would equal the voltage across the 100 Ω resistor. Is that true
    for the a.c. steady-state resonant case here? **Explain** your answer.

     

     

     

-   **Increase** the signal generator frequency (above the resonant frequency)
    until the voltage across the resistor falls to about 71% of its value
    at resonance. **Record** this frequency here.

     

     

-   **Decrease** the signal generator frequency (below the resonant frequency)
    until the voltage across the resistor falls to about 71% of its value
    at resonance. **Record** this frequency here.

     

     

-   The **difference** between the two frequencies where the resistor voltage
    falls to 70.7% of its value at resonance is defined to be the *bandwidth*
    of the resonant circuit. Calculate and **record** the measured
    bandwidth here.

     

     

-   Is the observed bandwidth within 10% of the calculated value? **Record**
    your observations here.
