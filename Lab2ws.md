# Series & Parallel Circuits Worksheet

## Series Circuits

-   Record the colors of the bands on R1 and R2, then use the resistor color
    code to determine the marked resistance value and tolerance for
    each resistor. Measure the actual value of the resistors.

      Resistor   Color Bands   Marked Value   Measured Value
      ---------- ------------- -------------- ----------------
      R1                                      
      R2                                      

-   Measure and record *V*~AC~, *V*~BA~, and *V*~BC~, the voltages across the
    voltage source, R1, and R2.

      Voltage    Measured Value
      ---------- ----------------
      $V_{AC}$   
      $V_{BA}$   
      $V_{CB}$   

-   Calculate the sum of the three voltage measurements.

    $V_{AC} + V_{BA} + V_{CB} =$

-   Does it appear that Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is satisfied when progressing
    clockwise around this loop? Justify your answer.

     

     

     

-   Measure and record *V*~CA~, *V*~AB~, and *V*~CB~, the voltages across the
    voltage source, R1, and R2.

      Voltage    Measured Value
      ---------- ----------------
      $V_{CA}$   
      $V_{AB}$   
      $V_{BC}$   

-   Calculate the sum of the three voltage measurements.

    $V_{CA} + V_{AB} + V_{BC} =$

-   Does it appear that Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is satisfied when progressing
    counter-clockwise around this loop? Justify your answer.

     

     

     

-   Measure and record the current through each resistor.

      Current   Measured Value
      --------- ----------------
      $I_{A}$   
      $I_{B}$   
      $I_{C}$   

-   Are the three current measurements consistent with the electrical
    definition of **series elements**?

     

     

     

## Parallel Elements

-   Record the colors of the bands on R3, then use the resistor color code to
    determine its marked resistance value and tolerance. Measure the actual
    value of the resistor.

      Resistor   Color Bands   Marked Value   Measured Value
      ---------- ------------- -------------- ----------------
      R3                                      

-   Measure the three currents **out of** (leaving) node **B**.

      Current     Measured Value
      ----------- ----------------
      $I_{OB1}$   
      $I_{OB2}$   
      $I_{OB3}$   

-   Calculate the sum of the three currents flowing out of node **B**.

    $I_{OB1} + I_{OB2} + I_{OB3} =$

-   Does it appear that Kirchhoff's Current Law is satisfied at node **B**?
    Justify your answer.

     

     

     

-   Measure the three currents **into** (entering) node **C**.

      Current     Measured Value
      ----------- ----------------
      $I_{IC1}$   
      $I_{IC2}$   
      $I_{ICS}$   

-   Calculate the sum of the three currents flowing into node **C**.

    $I_{IC1} + I_{IC2} + I_{ICS} =$

-   Does it appear that Kirchhoff's Current Law is satisfied at node **C**?
    Justify your answer.

     

     

     

-   How does $I_{OB3}$ compare to $I_{ICS}$? What would you expect to be the
    relationship between these two values?
