# Transient Response of RC and RL Circuits Worksheet

## RC Circuits

-   Calculate the time constant, $\tau$, of the *RC* circuit based on the
    marked component values.

-   Sketch the capacitor voltage waveform for one complete cycle.

-   Observe and record the actual time constant value. Is there reasonably good
    agreement between your calculated and observed values of $\tau$?

     

-   Sketch the resistor voltage waveform for one complete cycle below.

-   Recalculate the time constant after replacing the 2.2 kΩ resistor with a
    5.6 kΩ resistor.

     

-   Observe and record the actual time constant value. Is there reasonably good
    agreement between your calculated and observed values of $\tau$?

     

-   Repeat your sketches for the capacitor voltage and the resistor voltage.

## RL Circuits


-   Calculate and record the time constant of the RL circuit, based
    on the marked component values.

-   Observe and record the actual time constant. Is there reasonably
    good agreement between your calculated and observed values?

-   Sketch the inductor voltage waveform for one complete cycle below,
    recording the voltage scale and time scale values.

-   Swap the positions of the resistor and inductor in your circuit, so that
    one end of the resistor is connected to ground. Sketch the resistor voltage
    waveform for one complete cycle below.

<!--
14. Rebuild the original circuit but change the resistor value to 5.6 kΩ.
    Recalculate and **record** the time constant. Repeat your observations and
    sketches for the inductor voltage and the resistor voltage. The frequency
    of the waveform generator may have to be changed to achieve the flat
    sections at top and bottom of the waveforms.
