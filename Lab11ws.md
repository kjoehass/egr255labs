# Bode Plots Worksheet

### Procedure

-   Based on your understanding of impedance for inductors and capacitors, is
    the LC π filter a low-pass filter or a high-pass filter? **Justify**
    your answer.

-   **Measure** and **record** the peak-to-peak amplitude and phase delay of
    the output voltage, *V*~OUT~, with respect to *V*~IN~ at each test
    frequency.
    **Calculate** and **record** the gain of the circuit in both volts/volt and
    decibels for each test frequency. **Calculate** and **record** the period
    of each test frequency and the corresponding phase shift of the output,
    in degrees.

    Freq. (Hz)  Period  *V*~OUT~  Gain (V/V)  Gain (dB)  Phase Delay  Phase Shift (°)

-   Plot the gain and phase of the filter on semilog graph paper.

-   This filter has two poles (i.e. a double pole) at the same frequency.
    **Calculate** and **record** the pole frequency in **hertz**.

     

-   Is the shape of your plotted gain and phase data consistent with your
    understanding of how a Bode plot should look for this filter, given the
    number and frequency of its poles? **Explain** your answer.
