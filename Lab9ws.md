# Steady-state RC Circuits Worksheet

### Procedure

-   Compute and record the vertical scale of the computed resistor voltage
    waveform in volts per division.

    \ 

-   Compute and record the vertical scale of the corresponding resistor current
    waveform in amperes per division.

    \ 

-   Record the observed time difference between the capacitor voltage and
    capacitor current waveforms. Calculate and record the corresponding phase
    difference (in degrees) between the current and voltage.

    \ 

    \ 

-   Sketch the capacitor voltage and current waveforms for at least one
    complete cycle.

-   Record the RMS voltage of the function generator output, the voltage across
    the resistor, and the voltage across the capacitor.

    \ 

-   Based on the **voltmeter** measurements, does it appear that KVL is
    satisfied for this circuit? Explain your observations.

    \ 

    \ 

-   After changing the function generator frequency, record the observed time
    difference between the capacitor voltage and capacitor current waveforms.
    Calculate and record the corresponding phase difference (in degrees)
    between the current and voltage.

    \ 

-   Record the RMS voltage of the function generator output, the voltage across
    the resistor, and the voltage across the capacitor.

    \ 

    \ 

    \ 

-   Describe how your measurements and observations were different at the two
    function generator frequencies, and how they were the same.
