## Assembling & Verifying the Test Circuit

-   Select four resistors with four different values between 1 kΩ and 10 kΩ.

      Resistor   Color Bands   Marked Value   Measured Value
      ---------- ------------- -------------- ----------------
      R1                                      
      R2                                      
      R3                                      
      R4                                      

-   Measure and record the voltage across each element.

      Voltage    Measured Value
      ---------- ----------------
      $V_{V1}$   
      $V_{V2}$   
      $V_{R1}$   
      $V_{R2}$   
      $V_{R3}$   
      $V_{R4}$   

-   Verify your voltage measurements using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law around the
    upper loop, which includes V1, R1, and R2.

    $V_{SUM} = V_{CA} + V_{AB} + V_{BC} =$

    Does it appear that Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is satisfied around this loop?
    Justify your answer.

     

     

     

-   Verify the voltage measurements using KVL around the lower loop, which
    includes V2, R2, R3, and R4.

    $V_{SUM} = V_{EC} + V_{CB} + V_{BD} + V_{DE} =$

    Does it appear that Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is satisfied around this loop?
    Justify your answer.

     

     

     

-   Verify the voltage measurements using KVL around the outer loop, which
    includes V1, V2, R1, R3, and R4.

    $V_{SUM} = V_{CA} + V_{AB} + V_{BD} + V_{DE} + V_{EC} =$

    Does it appear that Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is satisfied around this loop?
    Justify your answer.

     

     

     

##Demonstrating superposition

-   "Zero out" V2 and measure the voltages across the remaining elements.

      Voltage     Measured Value
      ----------- ----------------
      $V_{V1}$    
      $V'_{R1}$   
      $V'_{R2}$   
      $V'_{R3}$   
      $V'_{R4}$   

-   "Zero out" V1 and measure the voltages across the remaining elements.

      Voltage      Measured Value
      ------------ ----------------
      $V_{V2}$     
      $V''_{R1}$   
      $V''_{R2}$   
      $V''_{R3}$   
      $V''_{R4}$   

-   Calculate the sum of the single-prime and double-prime voltages for
    each resistor.

    $V'_{R1} + V''_{R1} =$

    $V'_{R2} + V''_{R2} =$

    $V'_{R3} + V''_{R3} =$

    $V'_{R4} + V''_{R4} =$

-   Compare the sums you calculated above to the measured resistor voltages
    from the original circuit (with both voltage sources present). Does it
    appear that the principle of superposition is satisfied for this circuit?
    Justify your answer.
