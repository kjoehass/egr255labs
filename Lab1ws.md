# Making Laboratory Measurements Worksheet

## Measuring Resistance

-   Record the colors of the bands on each resistor and 
    determine the marked resistance value.
    Measure and record the actual value of the three resistors.
    Calculate and record the percentage error between the marked
    and measured values.

    Resistor  Color Bands  Marked Value  Measured Value  Error \[%\] 
    --------- ------------ ------------- --------------- ------------
    Example   BN-BK-RD-GD  1.0 kΩ ±5%    981 Ω           1.9%
    R1                                    
    R2                                    
    R3                                    

## Measuring Voltage

-   Measure the voltage across each resistor, moving clockwise around the loop.

      Voltage    Measured Value
      ---------- ----------------
      $V_{AD}$   
      $V_{BA}$   
      $V_{CB}$   
      $V_{DC}$   

-   Calculate the sum of the four voltage measurements. Does it appear that
    Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is satisfied around this loop? Justify your answer.

    $V_{AD} + V_{BA} + V_{CB} + V_{DC} =$

     

     

-   Measure the voltage across each resistor, moving counter-clockwise around
    the loop.

      Voltage    Measured Value
      ---------- ----------------
      $V_{DA}$   
      $V_{AB}$   
      $V_{BC}$   
      $V_{CD}$   

-   Calculate the sum of the four voltage measurements. Does it appear that
    Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is satisfied around this loop? Justify your answer.

    $V_{DA} + V_{CD} + V_{BC} + V_{AB} =$

     

     

## Measuring Current

-   Record *I*~CW~, the current flowing clockwise around the circuit loop,
    measured between **R1** and **R2**.

     

-   Record *I*~CCW~, the current flowing counter-clockwise around the circuit
    loop, measured between **R1** and **R2**.

     

-   Based on your understanding of how a current measurement is affected by the
    connections of the red and black probes, does it appear that the
    measurements of *I*~CW~ and *I*~CCW~ are *consistent*?

     

     

-   Record *I*~CW~, the current flowing clockwise around the circuit loop,
    measured between **R2** and **R3**.

     

-   Based on your understanding of how current flows in a circuit, does it
    appear that the two measurements of *I*~CW~ (at nodes **B** and **C**) are
    consistent?
