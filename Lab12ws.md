# Transformers

## Finding the ratio of turns

### Procedure

-   **Calculate** and **record** the turns ratio, *n*, for the transformer
    based on the rated voltages.

    \ 

-   **Measure** and **record** the voltage that appears across the full
    secondary winding of the transformer.

    \ 

-   **Calculate** and **record** the turns ratio, *n*, for the transformer
    using the measured voltage values for the primary and secondary.

    \ 

-   **Discuss** how the calculated value for *n* using the rated voltages
    compares to the value calculated from the measured voltages. You should
    expect these values to be within about 10% of each other.

## Finding the dotted connections

### Procedure

-   **Measure** and **record** the voltage from the *undotted* primary lead to
    the *unconnected* secondary lead.

    \ 

-   **Measure** and **record** the peak-to-peak voltages of both the primary
    and secondary. **Calculate** the turns ratio once again from the measured
    voltages and verify that it is essentially the same as the value you
    calculated from the RMS voltmeter measurements.

## Behavior with loaded secondary

### Procedure

-   **Measure** and **record** the resistance of the load resistor provided to
    you, to the nearest ohm.

    \ 

-   **Measure** and **record** the primary current with nothing but the
    oscilloscope connected to the secondary.

    \ 

-   **Record** the RMS voltage across the secondary winding after connecting
    the load resistor. Using the measured resistance value, **calculate** and
    **record** the secondary current.

    \ 

    \ 

-   With the resistor still connected across the secondary winding, **record**
    the RMS voltage across the primary winding as well as the primary current.

    \ 

    \ 

-   **Calculate** and **record** the *increase* in the primary current caused
    by adding a load to the secondary.

    \ 

    \ 

-   **Calculate** and **record** the turns ratio using the secondary current
    divided by the increase in primary current.
