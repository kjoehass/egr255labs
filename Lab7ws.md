# Operational Amplifier Application Worksheet

## Circuit Design

### Procedure

-   With RF chosen to be 27 kΩ, determine the appropriate values of RA and RB.

    \ 

    \ 

    \ 
-   You need to use a voltage divider to create *V*~OFF~, the 0.32 V constant
    offset voltage

    1.  Determine the voltage values that you will use for VPS+ and VPS-.

    \ 

    2.  **Calculate** the desired value of current through R2.

    \ 

    3.  **Calculate** the voltage across R1.

    \ 

    4.  **Calculate** the resistance value for R1.

    \ 

    5.  **Specify** the standard resistor values that you can connect
        together to achieve an equivalent resistance that is within 5% of the
        desired value of R1.

    \ 

    \ 

## Circuit Testing

-   **Record** the final value of R1 that you used and the measured value of
    *V*~OFF~. If you combined standard resistors to achieve the necessary value
    of R1, describe which standard values you selected and how you combined
    them (in series or in parallel).

    \ 

    \ 

-   **Compute** the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, as well as the
    corresponding voltage, to fill in the table below. Connect the DMM to
    measure the op-amp output voltage, *V*~F~. **Set** *V*~C~ to the
    appropriate voltage corresponding to the Celsius temperature, then
    **measure and record** the resulting value of *V*~F~, the amplifier
    output voltage. The difference between the desired value and the measured
    value should be less than 10%.
