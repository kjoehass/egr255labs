# Resistors and Ohm's Law Worksheet

## Series and Parallel Resistors

-   Record the colors of the bands on the three resistors, including the band
    (if any) that indicates the resistor's tolerance. Use the resistor color
    code to determine the marked resistance value for each resistor and record
    these values. Use your multimeter to measure the actual value of the
    three resistors. Record these values with (at least) three
    significant digits.

      Resistor   Color Bands   Marked Value   Measured Value
      ---------- ------------- -------------- ----------------
      R1                                      
      R2                                      
      R3                                      

-   Use the **measured** resistance values to calculate the equivalent
    resistance of R2 in parallel with R3, which we will refer to as R23.

    R23 =

-   Use the **measured** resistance values to calculate the equivalent
    resistance of R1 in series with R23, which we will refer to as REQ.

    REQ =

-   Measure and record the resistance between nodes **B** and **C**. How does
    the measured value compare to the calculated value of R23?

     

     

-   Measure and record the resistance between nodes **A** and **C**. How does
    the measured value compare to the calculated value of REQ?

     

## Ohm's Law

-   Measure and record the supply voltage, $V_{AC}$, with at least three
    significant digits.

     

-   Given the calculated value of REQ and the measured supply voltage, use
    Ohm's Law to calculate the value of $I_{SRC}$.

     

-   Break the circuit connection at node **A**, between the voltage source and
    R1, and measure $I_{SRC}$. How does the measured value of $I_{SRC}$ compare
    to the value you calculated above?

     

-   Use Ohm's Law to calculate the voltage across R1 ($V_{AB}$) and the voltage
    across R23 ($V_{BC}$).

     

-   Measure and record the voltages $V_{AB}$ and $V_{BC}$ with at least three
    significant digits. How do the measured values compare to the values you
    calculated using Ohm's Law above?

     

-   Suppose we apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to the loop formed by the voltage
    source, R1, and R23. What can you say about the relationship between the
    supply voltage, $V_{AC}$, and the voltage drops across R1 and R23? Are your
    calculations and measurements consistent with your expectations?

     

     

-   Use Ohm's Law to calculate the currents $I_{R2}$ and $I_{R3}$ using the
    measured value of $V_{BC}$ and the measured values of R2 and R3.

     

-   Considering the values you have calculated for $I_{SRC}$, $I_{R2}$, and
    $I_{R3}$, does it appear that Kirchhoff's Current Law is satisfied at node
    **B**? Explain your answer.

     

     

-   Measure $I_{R2}$ and $I_{R3}$. How do the calculated values of these
    currents compare to their measured values?
