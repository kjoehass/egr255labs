# Transient Response of RC and RL Circuits

In this laboratory procedure you will investigate the transient response of first-order circuits that comprise a resistor and a capacitor or a resistor and an
inductor.

## RC Circuits

### Procedure

1.  Construct the RC circuit shown below.

    ![Diagram of function generator connected to series resistor and
    capacitor](images/Lab8Fig1){.displayed} 

2.  Calculate and record the *RC* time constant, $\tau$, of this circuit.

3.  Set the function generator to give a square wave output with a peak-to-peak
    magnitude of about 1.0 V. Adjust the frequency of the function generator so
    that the period of the square wave is about 20 times the *RC* time constant
    of the circuit. Observe the output of the function generator with an
    oscilloscope and verify that the peak-to-peak voltage and period are
    as expected.

    ![Oscilloscope display of square wave](images/Lab8Fig4){.displayed} 

    When configured properly the oscilloscope display will resemble the
    image above. The small marker along the top edge of the display indicates
    the point **in time** where the oscilloscope triggers on the input
    waveform. The small "ground" symbol on the left edge indicates the vertical
    position on the screen that corresponds to 0 V. There is actually just one
    such marker for each displayed waveform, and it will be aligned either with
    the lowest voltage of the signal or with the 50% point of the voltage,
    depending on the type of signal generator that you are using.

4.  Now observe the voltage across the capacitor. Sketch the capacitor voltage
    waveform for one complete cycle below, which should resemble the image
    below.\
    ![Warning](images/GenericWarning11) Whenever you draw a sketch of a signal
    waveform you must be sure to record the voltage (vertical) scale and time
    (horizontal) scale values. Mark the left edge of your sketch to show where
    the ground marker is located.

5.  While observing the capacitor voltage, use the oscilloscope to determine
    how long it takes the voltage to reach 0.632 times its final value after
    the rising edge of the input signal. **Record** this value. Is there
    reasonably good agreement between your calculated and observed values of $\tau$?

6.  Swap the positions of the resistor and capacitor in your circuit, so that
    one end of the resistor is connected to ground.

    resistor](images/Lab8Fig2){.displayed} 

1.  Sketch the resistor voltage waveform for one complete cycle. 

7.  Rebuild the original circuit but change the resistor value to 5.6 kΩ.
    Recalculate and **record** the time constant based on the new resistor
    value.
    
1.  Repeat your time constant observation and the
    sketches for the capacitor voltage and the resistor voltage. The frequency
    of the waveform generator may have to be changed to achieve the flat
    sections at top and bottom of the waveforms.

## RL Circuits

### Procedure

1.  Construct the RL circuit shown below.

    ![Diagram of function generator connected to series resistor and
    inductor](images/Lab8Fig3){.displayed} 

2.  **Calculate** and **record** the time constant of this circuit.

3.  Adjust the frequency of the function generator so that the period of the
    square wave is about 20 times the *RL* time constant of the circuit. When
    viewing the waveform you should see definite flat sections at the top
    and bottom.

4.  While observing the inductor voltage, use the oscilloscope cursors to
    determine when the voltage reaches 0.632 times its final value after the
    rising edge of the input signal. **Record** this value. Is there reasonably
    good agreement between your calculated and measured values?

5.  Sketch the inductor voltage waveform for one complete cycle below,
    recording the voltage scale and time scale values.

6.  Swap the positions of the resistor and inductor in your circuit, so that
    one end of the resistor is connected to ground. Sketch the resistor voltage
    waveform for one complete cycle below.

14. Rebuild the original circuit but change the resistor value to 5.6 kΩ.
    Recalculate and **record** the time constant. Repeat your observations and
    sketches for the inductor voltage and the resistor voltage. The frequency
    of the waveform generator may have to be changed to achieve the flat
    sections at top and bottom of the waveforms.
